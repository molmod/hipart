HiPart is a program to analyze the electronic structure of molecules with
fuzzy-atom partitioning methods. It now supports four schemes to define atomic
partitions: the Becke scheme, The Hirshfeld scheme, the Iterative Hirshfeld
scheme, and the Iterative Stockholder Analysis. Within each scheme the following
quantities can be computed: atomic charges, atomic dipoles, quality of charges
and dipoles with respect to the ESP, the atomic multipole expansion, net and
overlap populations, bond orders and spin charges.
